In this post I will walk through how I made this very page.
My setup will be two GitHub repositories, one for the source of the page (https://github.com/bzoltan1/blog-source) and the other where the html artifacts are deployed (https://github.com/bzoltan1/bzoltan1.github.io)
Here I would like to note that it is possible to use a single repository with two branches, one for holding the the source and the other where the website is deployed.</description></item><item><title>Telegram Bridge</title><link>https://bzoltan1.github.io/telegram-bridge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 19:36:57 +0300</pubDate><guid>https://bzoltan1.github.io/telegram-bridge/</guid><description>Motivation I got lucky with my original hackweek project and I have managed to set up my Leap 15.3 based NAS and private cloud running on NextCloud earlier than planned.
So I though that as an extra project I will set up a proper system monitoring service. The monit service is very handy (thanks for the idea to Paolo Stivanin) but by default it wants to send emails when something goes wrong.</description></item></channel></rss>
