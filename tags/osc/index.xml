Are we successful, are we on the right track, are we heading to the right direction, are we fast enough, are we accelerating or slowing down?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This time I am talking about the openSUSE Linux Distribution and about the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And here I quickly would like to note an important disclaimer with a short story.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Contributing to SLE/openSUSE</title><link>https://bzoltan1.github.io/contributing-to-sle/opensuse/</link><pubDate>Sat, 19 Feb 2022 06:42:50 +0300</pubDate><author>zoltan.balogh@suse.com (Zoltán Balogh)</author><guid>https://bzoltan1.github.io/contributing-to-sle/opensuse/</guid><description>&lt;p>The motivation of this post is to demonstrate how easy and logical is the workflow of an upstream change in a project to a given SUSE Linux codestream. I try to write this post in a codestream agnostic way. As I have experienced the workflow from the package maintainer point of view is the same for SUSE:SLE-15:Update and for openSUSE:Factory.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-i-want-to-do">What I want to do&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It all starts with a Bugzilla case. For the sake of this exercise I will walk through the process with this bug report: &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1195126">https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1195126&lt;/a> I use this case because it was a fairly simple, straight forward issue. It is a CVE-2022-0351: vim: uncontrolled recursion in eval7(). This is a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) what means that somebody has found and published an information-security vulnerabilities and exposures. By classification it is an important issue and as a package maintainer it is not my role to re-evaluate if the issue represents serious threat or not. My goal is to figure out if I can reproduce the issue and if I can find a fix for it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
