&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s start by clarifying what we mean by cross-building and cross-packaging. Cross-compilation is the process of compiling source code on one platform, called the host, in order to generate an executable binary for a different target platform. The emphasis here is on the word &amp;ldquo;different&amp;rdquo;. The target platform may have a different CPU architecture, such as when we work on an x86 computer and want to build software for a Raspberry Pi board with an ARM CPU. But even if the target platform has the same CPU architecture as the host, there may be several other possible differences. For example, the host may be running &lt;a href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianUnstable">Debian Sid&lt;/a>, while the target may be running &lt;a href="https://www.opensuse.org/#Leap">openSUSE Leap&lt;/a>. Different Linux distributions may have different compilers, linkers, and run-time libraries. Even when using the same distribution as the host for the target, they may be different releases, such as openSUSE Tumbleweed and Leap. In short, nothing guarantees that the target system will have the same shared libraries as the host system.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
