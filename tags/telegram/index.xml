&lt;p>I used to have a Synology DS414 server what worked  well for about 8 years. Naturally, occasionally I had to change disks in the RAID5 system in it, but other than that it did its job. But regardless of the really smooth user experience and the low maintenance needs I never really liked that system as the Synology Disk Station Manager OS is not like many &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; Linux distributions and the community behind that OS is basically non existent. And to be honest I do not really feel that Synology is very eager to build and maintain a community around their OS. It looks more like that they just barely comply with the GPL. All in all, I had just enough motivation to migrate my private cloud and NAS to a proper OS.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Telegram Bridge</title><link>https://bzoltan1.github.io/telegram-bridge/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 19:36:57 +0300</pubDate><author>zoltan.balogh@suse.com (Zoltán Balogh)</author><guid>https://bzoltan1.github.io/telegram-bridge/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="motivation">Motivation&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>I got lucky with my original hackweek project and I have managed to set up my Leap 15.3 based NAS and private cloud running on NextCloud earlier than planned.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I though that as an extra project I will set up a proper system monitoring service. The monit service is very handy (thanks for the idea to Paolo Stivanin) but by default it wants to send emails when something goes wrong. Instead of emails I would prefer a real instant message. I am using mostly Telegram for personal purposes. Sure I am using Signal, Matrix, Slack and Rocket.Chat too and technically I have WhatsApp account too. But I decided to start with Telegram.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
