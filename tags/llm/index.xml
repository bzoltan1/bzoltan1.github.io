&lt;p>When my family moved to a new place. In our previous home we had a district heating service that included unlimited hot water for a fixed price. That was awesome - not very environmentally friendly and actually not very cheap, but we never ran out of hot water.&lt;/p>


&lt;div class="box" style="max-width:50%">
 &lt;figure itemprop="associatedMedia" itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/ImageObject">
 &lt;div class="img">
 &lt;img itemprop="thumbnail" src="https://bzoltan1.github.io/the-boiler.jpg" alt="The boiler"/>
 &lt;/div>
 &lt;a href="https://bzoltan1.github.io/the-boiler.jpg" itemprop="contentUrl">&lt;/a>
 &lt;/figure>
&lt;/div>

&lt;p>In our new home we are independent from the city&amp;rsquo;s hot water services. This is good because we pay exactly for the energy we use. It means that we have a 300-liter hot water heater that we turn on when we want to make as much hot water as we need. In most households such a hot water boiler has a thermostat set to a specific temperature and the heater keeps all 300 liters of water as hot as it is set. I do not like this, because regardless of how great the insulation on the water tank is, it loses temperature over time. I needed a smarter system.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Building a Local Bugzilla RAG System</title><link>https://bzoltan1.github.io/building-a-local-bugzilla-rag-system/</link><pubDate>Fri, 23 May 2025 10:00:00 +0200</pubDate><author>zoltan.balogh@suse.com (Zoltán Balogh)</author><guid>https://bzoltan1.github.io/building-a-local-bugzilla-rag-system/</guid><description>&lt;p>My goal was to build a local database that could:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Ingest my ~4GB Bugzilla database&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Answer questions or give advice on new bugs based on historical ones&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run offline on my openSUSE Tumbleweed machine, which is equipped with 64GB RAM and an AMD Ryzen 7 PRO 7840U&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Naturally, my first idea was to build a standalone LLM like GPT. But fine-tuning an LLM on custom data is resource-intensive—a massive understatement. When I started to fine-tune an LLM on my laptop, I let the process run for a full week, and it reached only 1%. Using cloud-based services or investing in powerful new hardware were not options. Also, the problem with standalone LLMs is that they may hallucinate or generate inaccurate information, especially on domain-specific topics. The other disadvantage of using LLMs is that they are static; once trained, they don&amp;rsquo;t know anything that happened afterward.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
