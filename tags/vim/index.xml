I try to write this post in a codestream agnostic way. As I have experienced the workflow from the package maintainer point of view is the same for SUSE:SLE-15:Update and for openSUSE:Factory.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="what-i-want-to-do">What I want to do&lt;/h3>
&lt;p>It all starts with a Bugzilla case. For the sake of this exercise I will walk through the process with this bug report: &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1195126">https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1195126&lt;/a> I use this case because it was a fairly simple, straight forward issue. It is a CVE-2022-0351: vim: uncontrolled recursion in eval7(). This is a Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) what means that somebody has found and published an information-security vulnerabilities and exposures. By classification it is an important issue and as a package maintainer it is not my role to re-evaluate if the issue represents serious threat or not. My goal is to figure out if I can reproduce the issue and if I can find a fix for it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
